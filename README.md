qb-vehiclekeys but working with qb-lock

There is a few versions on here but they are outdated versions of qb-vehiclekeys. 
This will allow you to lockpick the door and hotwire the vehicle using the qb-lock function (circle minigame)
Since this is the newest version of qb-vehiclekeys you can adjust it in the config if you would like to have driving npc's doors be locked or unlocked by default,
same with parked cars. Enjoy!


Thanks to Booya#0001 for the original snippet and to the people at qbcore-framework for creating the original repo!
